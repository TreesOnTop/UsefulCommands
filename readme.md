UsefulCommands aims to add commands that minecraft should've had in the first place. UsefulCommands doesn't overwrite
any vanilla commands so there should be no conflicts when adding to your server. To request features go to the issues
section and add the feature request tag or bug report tag if you're reporting a bug.
